# Orchard AEG

## Usage

Run Dev Server

```
npm start
```

## Build for production

```
npm run build
```

## Decisions
I've decided to use [Handlebars JS](https://handlebarsjs.com/) to emulate a CMS like environment where HTMLs can be breakdown to its own part (layouts, partials, etc.) to make it reusable and scalable. I think this can be improved by adding SSR feature.
